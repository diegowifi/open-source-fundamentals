# Final thoughts

![Great](http://i.imgur.com/6XSNnoA.jpg?2 "Oh yeah")

That´s it, now you know how awesome open source is. I wanted to make this book as short as I could so most people could read it in about 20 minutes or so, but at the same time I wanted to explain the important stuff you have to know about the subject and I think I did well. If you think my book needs to cover more fundamentals about open source, spot some typos, or notice something´s wrong please let me know and/or contribute with the [repository](https://github.com/diegowifi/open-source-fundamentals) on GitHub, pull requests are welcome.

If you liked what I wrote, learned something new and/or want to tell me what you think feel free to send me a [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/Diego_WiFi). By the way, all donations are very welcome, this motivates me to write more Gitbooks with more cool content, and of course, **free** for you all.

Have fun with your code, thank you.
